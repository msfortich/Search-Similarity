## **Methodology**

### **1. Data Collection & Preparation**
- **Source**: Monthly Amazon search query logs.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Cleaned and normalized search queries (lowercasing, punctuation removal, etc.).
  - Tokenized text data and generated Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectors.

### **2. Cosine Similarity Analysis**
- **Goal**: Measure semantic similarity between search terms.
- **Steps**:
  - Constructed a TF-IDF matrix to represent search terms numerically.
  - Calculated cosine similarity scores to link new search terms with existing trends.

### **3. Data Integration**
- **Output**: Structured csv results containing:
  - Search term pairs.
  - Similarity scores.
  - Mapped trend categories.


### **4. Trend Analysis**
- Linked search terms with broader market trends.
- Grouped related terms to provide actionable insights.
